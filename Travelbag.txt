Tooth Paste
But no tooth brush, this dude likes to use his fingers and a towel
I wonder if he ever flosses. I mean, if you don't even give enough shits
to use a tooth brush, then there could be no way you would floss. Maybe
I am super wrong here. Who knows. 
Shoes, but just flip flops. He brought socks just in case. Who knows maybe 
his feet will get a little cold. 
Sun Tan Lotion, does he tan? We don't know. But I do get the feeling that he is
more of a stay inside and watch cartoons kind of vacation kind of guy. You know 
the minnibars are not to expensive any more. Cheep little bottles and tiwx bars, man.
