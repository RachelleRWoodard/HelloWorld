Says A, give me a good large slice,
Says B, a little bit, but nice,
Says C, cut me a piece of crust, Take it, says D, it’s dry as dust,
Says E, I’ll eat it fast, I will, Says F, I vow I’ll have my fill,
Says G, give it me good and great, Says H, a little bit I hate,
Says I, it’s ice I must request, Says J, the juice I love the best,
Says K, let’s keep it up above, Says L, the border’s what I love,
Says M, it makes your teeth to chatter, N said, it’s nice, there’s nought the matter,
O others’ plates with grief surveyed, P for a large piece begged and prayed,
Q quarrelled for the topmost slice, R rubbed his hands and said “it’s nice,”
S silent sat, and simply looked, T thought, and said, it’s nicely cooked,
U understood the fruit was cherry, V vanished when they all got merry,
W wished there’d been a quince in, X here explained he’d need convincing,
Y said, I’ll eat, and yield to none, Z, like a zany, said he’d done,
While ampersand purloined the dish, And for another pie did wish.[5]
